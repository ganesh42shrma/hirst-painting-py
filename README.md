# hirst-painting-py
This Python script uses the Turtle Graphics library and the colorgram library to create a digital interpretation of a spot painting inspired by Damien Hirst.

##Project Overview:
The script generates a series of colored dots in a grid pattern, mimicking the aesthetic of Hirst's spot paintings. The color palette used is inspired by the original Hirst spot paintings.

##Usage:
Install required libraries:
pip install python-turtle
pip install colorgram.py

##Run the script:
python hirst_spot_painting.py

##Code Highlights:
Color Extraction: The script originally used the colorgram library to extract colors from an image, but the code is commented out. The color list is now manually provided in the script.

Turtle Graphics: The Turtle module is employed to draw and display the spot painting.

Grid Formation: The dots are arranged in a grid pattern, with a new row starting every 10 dots.
